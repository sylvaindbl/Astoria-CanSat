Here is the Repository from Astoria CanSat, the winner team of the Belgium 2024 CanSat competition.

You can use the data we recovered from our sensors and try to make something more visual than series of numbers.
You can also look at our codes for inspiration (these ones were used for the live on youtube but don't really work in post production)

Our 3D models are available on sketchfab: https://sketchfab.com/astoria_cansat
Lot of resources are on our website, so feel free to check it: https://astoria-cansat1.odoo.com
